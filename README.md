> ##### __Notice__
> The Vanilla API is still undergoing development and gets rewritten every so often. Do therefore __not__ use it for __anything__ just yet. You're more than welcome to take a look at the source though and any contribution would be greatly appreciated!

## Getting started

To get started using Vanilla API, either:

* __[Download the latest release](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-api/archive/master.zip)__
* Clone the repository directly into your Vanilla `applications` directory:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-api.git api
```

When you've done this, make sure the newly created folder is named `api` and not `vanilla-api`. Now simply go to your dashboard, enable Vanilla API in the "Applications" menu and you're all set!

## How does it work?

Vanilla API is in fact not an API in itself. A more fitting description would be that it's a mapper tool whose purpose is to implement a RESTful URI scheme upon with you can invoke different methods using the standard GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP verbs. It also translates PUT and DELETE requests into POST requests so that Garden can understand and process these.

In the end, you can look at Vanilla API as being an application that sits of top of the default API, translating and handling different requests for use by the application and core controllers who in return carry out the actual methods.

## Documentation

You can find documentation on how to use, configure and extend Vanilla API in the [Wiki](https://github.com/kasperisager/vanilla-api/wiki).
